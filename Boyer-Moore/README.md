## Boyer-Moore.cpp

just a simple source code for Boyer and Moore:

there are 2 options in main:
1 for manually input string and pattern
2 for input from file

There are 5 files sample input:

+ input1.txt: large string, small pattern
+ input2.txt: repeated pattern
+ input3.txt: fully matched pattern
+ input4.txt: no matched pattern
+ input5.txt: large string, large pattern

## check_with_naive.cpp

make sure the implemented code is correct by comparing it with naive algorithm

## compare.cpp

compare the time complexity between Boyer-Moore, KMP and Naive algorithm
